This is a small interface for the Plugwise circles. It is capable of communicating 
with circles and display the current power usage. A simple call is:

 $ pw-read /dev/cu.usbserial-A700drcq 000D6F0000769E4C 000D6F00007293BD
 000D6F0000769E4C: 44.7917 Watt
 000D6F00007293BD: 89.4926 Watt
 
The first parameter is the serial device of the Plugwise stick, the second and third are 
the full ID of a plugwise circle. The program outputs the current power consumption in 
watts.

BUILDING
You need to have CMake installed in order to compile the code. Just enter
 
 $ make

in order to build the software.  It has been developed on a Mac, but should run 
unmodified on any POSIX machine, including Linux and *BSD. I also tested it on a 
Debian/ARM machine.

By default, the code does not print extended logging messages. If you want to enable
this, edit the cmake cache and set the ENABLE_LOGGING variable to "ON":

 $ ccmake build/
 $ make

This library builds on the knowledge documented by Maarten Damen in "Plugwise unleashed".
The original "Source" software has not been analyzed or disassembled in any way.

LICENSE
The library is released unter the terms of the GPLv3.
