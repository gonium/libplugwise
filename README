This is a small interface for the Plugwise circles. It is capable of communicating 
with circles and display the current power usage. A simple call is:

 $ pw-read /dev/cu.usbserial-A700drcq 000D6F00007293BD

The first parameter is the serial device of the Plugwise stick, the second is the full ID
of a plugwise circle.

The interface has been developed on a Mac, but should run unmodified on any POSIX 
machine, including Linux and *BSD.

This library builds on the knowledge documented by Maarten Damen in "Plugwise unleashed".
The original "Source" software has not been analyzed or disassembled in any way.
